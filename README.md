# Cast
iPhone application to cast videos on the web to the TV using chromecast

Note:
  Must install Google Cast CocoaPod for this app to work
  
How to use:
  Just open any page that has videos and click on the media button on the toolbar, then the video link should appear automatically in the table. Now, just click on the cell that contains the video link and it should start casting on TV, but you must first make sure the chromecast is powered and connect to it through the cast button on the navigation bar.
  
Happy Casting!
